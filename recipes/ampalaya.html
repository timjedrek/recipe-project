    <h1>What is Ampalaya?</h1>
    Ampalaya is actually the name of a fruit that is prominent in the pacific islands and you may know it as "bitter melon".  Many different cultures have their own way of preparing this fruit.  Today we'll see how I was taught how to cook this yummy dish!  Be warned though, as the name implies this fruit is extremely bitter and if you've never had it before then you may not like it.  But fear not, over time you will acquire a taste for it and in addition, it is very good for our health.  Ampalaya has tons of vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants to keep you feeling fresh and awesome!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <li>ham, spam, porkbelly or other type of pork based meat</li>
        <li>Egg</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Let's start cooking!</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ingredients.  Cut your meat into small peices.  Cut the ampalaya and remove the middle part.  Cut onions and mince garlic.</li>
        <li>Soak the cut ampalaya in salt water.  This will help make the ampalaya less bitter.</li>
        <li>Add oil to the pot or pan and heat the oil up.</li>
        <li>When the oil is ready, add onions and garlic.  Simmer until the onions start caramelizing.</li>
        <li>Add the meat and stir occasionally until cooked</li>
        <li>Add the ampalaya and keep the lid closed as much as possible.  This will keep the steam in the container which will soften the ampalaya.</li>
        <li>Add eggs and stir until the egg hardens</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce</li>
        <li>Add tomatoes</li>
        <li>Bon appetit!</li>
    </ol>
