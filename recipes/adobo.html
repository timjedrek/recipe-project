        <li>Prepare the ingredients first.  Cut meat into peices with your own discretion.  If using potatoes and carrots, cut those also to an appropriate size.  Cut onions and mince garlic.</li>
        <li>Put oil in a pan and cook at medium heat</li>
        <li>Once oil is ready, put the onions and garlic into the pan.  Stir occasionally until the onions are caramelized.</li>
