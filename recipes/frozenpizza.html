    <h1>What is Frozen Pizza?</h1> 
    Ah yes, frozen pizza.  If you can't make ampalaya or adobo, then rather than giving up and starving to death you can make a frozen pizza!  Frozen pizza is pizza prepared in a factory which makes it convenient to prepare.  High in calories and not as tasty, but knock back a few shots of whiskey and frozen pizza might turn into a super gourmet and delicious meal.
